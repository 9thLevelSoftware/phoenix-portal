# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Premium subscribers see data and insights about their training that they cannot get anywhere else -- force curves, velocity trends, muscle balance analysis, and community-driven workout programming -- making the subscription feel indispensable.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 - Stabilization

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 7 (Stabilization)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-15 -- Completed 00-02-PLAN.md (test framework, code splitting, error boundaries)

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 8% (3/38 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.22 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 00-stabilization | 3/3 | 13 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 00-01 (4 min), 00-03 (3 min), 00-02 (6 min)
- Trend: n/a (need more data)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 0 stabilization before any features (62+ bugs, 6 critical)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4/5/7 can parallelize after Phase 3 completes
- [Roadmap]: EXP-01 through EXP-03 grouped with Phase 7 (integrations) not Phase 1 (data)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Session Replay) depends on Phase 4 (biomechanics visx foundation)
- [00-01]: Hardcoded theme="dark" in sonner.tsx instead of next-themes (app is dark-only)
- [00-01]: MobileBottomNav in App.tsx is canonical mobile nav; removed duplicate from Navigation.tsx
- [00-01]: useIsMobile hook is standard mobile detection pattern (replaces inline useState+resize)
- [00-03]: Used sharp for image conversion (dev dependency stays for future re-generation)
- [00-03]: WebP quality 85 balances file size and visual quality
- [00-03]: XL logo loads eagerly (landing hero), others lazy-load
- [00-03]: Original 1.8MB PNG kept as source, just removed imports
- [00-02]: Class-based IntersectionObserver mock required for framer-motion compatibility in tests
- [00-02]: Navigation/MobileBottomNav/Toaster kept as static imports (always visible layout shell)
- [00-02]: Each early-return path in App.tsx gets its own ErrorBoundary+Suspense wrapper

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Supabase schema not yet finalized on mobile side -- data model mapping may need revision
- [Phase 4]: VBT zone thresholds need sports science research during planning
- [Phase 7]: Hevy API access uncertain (may need CSV import fallback)
